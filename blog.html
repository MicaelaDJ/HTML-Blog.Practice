    <h2>Potato vs Chocolate</h2>
    <div class="potato">
      <h3>Potato Chips</h3>
      <p>Potato chips (often just chips), or crisps, are thin slices of potato that have been deep fried or baked until crunchy. They are commonly served as a snack, side dish, or appetizer. The basic chips are cooked and salted; additional varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including herbs, spices, cheeses, other natural flavors, artificial flavors, and additives.</p>
      <h3>Chocolate Chips</h3>
      <p>Chocolate chips or chocolate morsels are small chunks of sweetened chocolate, used as an ingredient in a number of desserts <span class="pain">(notably chocolate chip cookies and muffins)</span>, in trail mix and less commonly in some breakfast foods such as pancakes. They are often manufactured as teardrop-shaped volumes with flat circular bases; another variety of chocolate chips have the shape of rectangular or square blocks. They are available in various sizes, usually less than 10 millimetres (0.39 in) in diameter.</p>

    <h2>When not to dip</h2>
    <div class="dip">
      <p>Double-dipping involves biting a chip and then re-dipping it into a dip, which some people disapprove, while others are indifferent. Double-dipping ostensibly transfers bacteria from a person's mouth into a dip, which can then be transferred to other consumers' mouths.</p>
      <p>In March 2013, Tostitos, a U.S. brand of tortilla chips and dips, hired the Ketchum communications agency to perform a survey concerning double dipping that polled over 1,000 Americans. The survey found that 46% of male participants double-dip at a party, compared to 32% of females. 54% stated that they would not consume dip after seeing another person double-dip, and 22% stated that they did not care. 25% stated that they would verbally object to a person caught double-dipping.</p>
      <p>A study performed by the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at Clemson University claimed that three to six instances of double-dipping "would transfer about 10,000 bacteria from the eaterâ€™s mouth to the remaining dip," which corresponds with "about 50-100 bacteria from one mouth to another, in every bite." The study's conclusion recommended that double-dipping should, in their opinion, be curtailed, including tips to prevent it from occurring.</p>
      <p>A segment on MythBusters in 2009 tested how much bacteria is transferred during the process of double-dipping, finding that there is a transfer but that it, "adds only a few more microbes".</p>

    <h2>Fish and...</h2>
    <div class="fish">
      <p>Fish and chips is a hot dish of English origin consisting of fried fish in batter served with chips. It is a common take-away food in the United Kingdom and an early example of culinary fusion. Fish and chips first appeared in the UK in the 1860s. <span class="trouble">By 1910 there were more than 25,000 fish and chip shops across the UK, and by the 1930s there were over 35,000.</span> Fish and chips are now a staple takeaway meal in numerous countries, particularly in English-speaking and Commonwealth countries.</p>

    <h2>Dale</h2>
    <div class="dale">
      <p>Chip and Dale (also rendered as Chip 'n' Dale or Chip an' Dale) are two chipmunk cartoon characters created at Walt Disney Productions in 1943. Their names are a pun based on the name of the famous 18th-century cabinet maker and furniture designer Thomas Chippendale. This was suggested by Bill "Tex" Henson, a story artist at the studio.</p>

      <p>Of the two, Chip is portrayed as being safe, focused, and having a mind for logical scheming. Dale, by contrast, is more laid-back, dim-witted, and impulsive, and has a very strong sense of humor. Originally the two had a very similar appearance, but as a way to tell them apart, some differences were introduced: Chip has a small black nose (which somewhat resembles a chocolate "chip", as befitting his name) and two centered protruding teeth, whereas Dale has a large dark red nose and a prominent gap between his front teeth. Chip is also depicted as having smooth hair on top of his head while Dale's tends to be ruffled.</p>
